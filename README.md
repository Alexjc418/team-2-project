I will be working on the data cleaning and the github repo

Abstract:
The project we are proposing is to help combat against the decline in air quality and excessive amounts of methane as well as CO2 in the United States. We will gather our data from the website Kaggle and focus on the effects of the air quality in the United States to get a more controlled but still broad data set. Furthermore, our problem to be solved is to improve the air quality and reduce the immoderate amount of methane and CO2 as this is important to the future generations from where we live. Our expected outcome is to point out what is affecting us the most in terms of the three gases. Our second outcome is to find a solution towards guiding people on how to reduce CO2, Methane, and improve air quality in their daily lives while also being a good example to other countries so that they can find ways to improve theirs.
